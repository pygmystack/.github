# Welcome to pygmystack

The pygmy stack is a container stack for local development.

It is a collaboration between:
- [amazee.io](https://www.amazee.io) - Initial development of pygmy, and its predecessor, [cachalot](https://github.com/amazeeio/cachalot)
- [@fubarhouse](https://github.com/fubarhouse) - complete rewrite of pygmy in Golang (Thanks Karl!)
- [the Lagoon team](https://lagoon.sh) - ongoing support and maintenance

Please log any issues in the relevant repositories.
